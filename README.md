# Protobuf example

Ensure you have the `protoc` binary installed:

    brew install protobuf

Install the Python `protobuf` library in your virtual env of choice:

    pip install protobuf
    
`users_pb2.py` is autogenerated from `users.proto` that defines the protobuf interface.

If you make changes to the proto file, you can update `users_pb2.py` with:

    protoc --python_out=. users.proto 
    
Write a file:

    python write.py
    
Read the generated file:

    python read.py
